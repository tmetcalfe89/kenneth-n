2. Inside of the root directory of the project on your local machine, run `npm i` to install prerequisites.
3. Inside of the root directory of the project on your local machine, have one terminal runu `npm run start:server` and another run `npm run start:client`.

## Current Challenge

We now have a shell of a front end and a Sign Up route on our back end. Can you connect the two using either `axios` or `fetch` in the corresponding function we have on the front end?
